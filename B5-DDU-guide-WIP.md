## 1. Introduction

We hope you find the order and assembly process smooth, and a reminder that we are always available to help through the discord. Simply post your questions in the #diy-and-simgear channel and one of our staff (or helpful members) will try to assist. This guide covers all the necessary information to assemble your wheel, as well as links to the required shifters and clutches. Without further ado, let's begin.

## 2. Safety notes

#### With any DIY project we must ensure we are safe at all times to avoid any potential injury or damage. Our recommendations are the following:

1. Always wear safety glasses, particularly when performing steps such as sanding the 3D print
2. Ensure any soldering is done in a well ventilated area, using a fan to pull away dangerous fumes if possible
3. Wear gloves to avoid later contamination when soldering with leaded solder.
4. Find a comfortable position to avoid back pain later on, this wheel takes quite a while to assemble and it is better to do it comfortably.

## 3. Bom and parts

The BOM is available [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LTHWi-7xIeATiLtcv8ewfXO0zlp6xbxwbrMM7N581tc/edit#gid=1313035800) and you can make your own copy to tick off parts as you go.

It's a good idea to order everything before starting so that you don't miss anything or end up with incorrect parts. The BOM also contains some useful tips on what parts to order and recommendations, _as well as some recommended tools for the job!_ We have intentionally left some flexibility with the parts (eg: switches from either AliExpress or Mouser) so you can make the decision on how much you'd like to spend. In general, the extra money does reflect extra quality but if you think you can get a great deal somewhere else, go for it! That's the benefit of DIY ðŸ™‚ \*Velocitas Imperium are not endorsing any of these parts, just making helpful suggestions if you are struggling to source the parts yourself\*

We will now cover some specifics for ordering certain items, such as the **Graphics/Adhesives, CNC,** and the **PCB**.

## 3.1 Plexiglass + UV print

You can order a 2mm transparent Plexiglas plate, with our supplied UV print file, there is an extra PNG file included to show what should be transparent and where it should not be (BLUE = Transparent), both files should be sent to your preferred manufacturer.


## 4. Preparing 3D Printed parts

The following settings are intended for use with a 0.4mm nozzle and wall line count (perimeters) of 4 (printing times with and ender 3)
